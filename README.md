# Conways-Game-of-Life-Tutorial-React

This project was a refactor of a tutorial from 3 years ago. The general logic remains the same with the key difference being that I used Functional Components with Hooks instead of Class Components.

Conway's Game of Life is a Zero-Player game that simulates cellular automaton.

I built this project in conjunction with a tutorial video made by FreeCodeCamp https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PM0_Er3SvFQ. The real test of the project has been learning to better understand hooks and how they work in relation to vanilla state. There were more than a few challenges along the way where I thought I could easily transition from Class to Functional but needed to better understand one thing or another. This project as a whole was a learning experience.
